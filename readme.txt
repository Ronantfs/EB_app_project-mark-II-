Second (on- going) build of "exam builder app": 

a tool to suport teachers & students with archiving/ organising of  questions & then compliing these into collections: 'Exams'. 

Exams can be strucutred so as to target specific sections of a syllabus. 

Student performance on these exams updates a data-base, and this data is then used to generate future exams 
- thus, over time  exams should converge towards what is exactly required by a student to progress.
